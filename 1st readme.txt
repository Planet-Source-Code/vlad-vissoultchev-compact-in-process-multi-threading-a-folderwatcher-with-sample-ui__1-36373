First, in folder FolderWatcher register ThreadAPI.tlb 
	- Use RegTLib.exe from Windows\System (WINNT\System32) folder
	- Use VB Project Menu->Reference->Press [Browse...] and select the FolderWatcher\ThreadAPI.tlb
	
Then, in folder FolderWatcher open FolderWatcher.vbp and compile to FolderWatcher.dll

Finally, in folder Project1 open Project1 to see the demo.

!!!Warning!!! Do not try to run BOTH project INSIDE the VB IDE -- it crashes ferociously!
