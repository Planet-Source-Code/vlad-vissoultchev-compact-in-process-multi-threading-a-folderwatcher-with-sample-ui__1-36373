### Description

Well, here you have it: multi-threaded component using FindFirstChangeNotification API, compactly implemented in 386 lines of code and a 285 lines of sample UI:-))) And most of these are VB codelines which are not overly commented, be warned, this is not for the faintest of heart! Greatly inspired by http://www.relisoft.com/Win32/watcher.html. Attempted an implementation after a short conversation with NovaSoft about Walter Brebels' Directory Monitor. It can successfully monitor for recursive changes in the sub-folders, too. Hope you find a useful use for this component. Please, read [1st readme.txt] first! Enjoy, and leave your votes!
